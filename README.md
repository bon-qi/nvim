## How to use
Make sure network is fine, necessary packages installed (gcc, git, etc).
1. clone this file into your configure file of nvim
```
git clone https://github.com/bon-qi/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
```
2. open `nvim`, and type `:PackerInstall` or `:PackerSync` to install packages.
Everything is done! Happy `neovim`!

## Make sure
1. `nvim` has a relative new version. (won't work for `nvim.__version__ == 0.4.3`, need `nvim-ppa`).
2. can reach `github.com` freely. (maybe proxy).
